# What do I use this repo for?
As everyone knows, you can start you own repo with the name <yourusername>.github.io, and everything you put there will be
presented on this adress. I use this for small things, written only in client-side technologies (because of course this won't
provide you with a server). 

## The things that are, or were, here
### Hillai
As programmers, me and some of my friends tend to use programmers humor in birthday jokes. One of this friends is Hillai,
and for one his birthdays I wrote down a primitive HTML page that can be used to generate a random inside joke and a photo of him.
Everything there is inside humor and the code is very primitive, as I did it in about 30 minutes, on a random school computer.
